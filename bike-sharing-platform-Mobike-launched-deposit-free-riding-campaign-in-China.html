<div class="dpost"><p><h2 class="dh2">no more deposit for Mobike</h2>

<p>Mobike started a campaign that allows users to get access to its bike-sharing service free of deposit on July 5.It is a signal that after being acquired by Meituan dianping,a Chinese one-stop life service platform backed by Tencent,Mobike is armed with sufficient fund to rejoin the bike-sharing battlefield and is confident to sustain growth.</p>
<p><img src="https://mobike.com/global/public/home__feature_1_image.jpg" alt="user interface of mobike app" style="width: 450px;"></p>
<p>After the announcement,a number of users rushed to log in the Mobike app to take their 299 yuan back.But some people found the evil is in the details.If users were impatient and didn't see the guide,they would probably end up buying a service card of 6 months and could only got the deposit of 199 yuan.</p>
<h2 class="dh2">deposit rumors around bike-sharing platforms</h2>

<p>Mobike had collected deposits from users and use that money to kept the company running.Although Mobike denied that the financing the company had collected from users was never misallocated,people still hold the belief that bike sharing companies tend to use their deposits to cover the spending and Mobike is no exception.Last winter,it was repeatedly reported that bike-sharing companies,including ofo and Mobike had taken advantage of users' deposits in order to survive.Recently,ofo denied the allegations of using users' deposits on June 11.</p>
<p>While Mobike has dropped the deposit policy,ofo is doing the opposite.The company has already removed its own deposit-free service.Users need to pay a deposit of 199 yuan when it comes to 20 cities.But ofo does not completely give up deposit-free policy and users in big cities like Shanghai,Guangzhou,Shenzhen,Hangzhou and Xiamen can still enjoy the free meal. </p>

<p>Meituan dianping has bought Mobike and saved Mobike from running out of funding.Since Meituan's founder Wang Xing said that Mobike is part of Meituan's platform strategy,Mobike will not easily be defeated and is going to fight till the end of the industry.</p>
<h2 class="dh2">a brief look at China's bike-sharing industry landscape</h2>

<p>It was reported that ofo's main investor,Didi chuxing,had suggested that ofo should be acquired by Didi chuxing.The suggestion was not accepted by Dai Wei,the founder of the bike-sharing startup.Dai Wei is always preferring the company to be independent.Didi chuxing aims to take over the whole transportation industry of China.After ofo's refusal,Didi chuxing launched its own bike-sharing service.</p>
<p>Alibaba once wanted to pursue an assertive alliance with ofo,since ofo's biggest rival,Mobike receives Tencent's funding.Tencent,Chinese social media and gaming giant,is increasingly becoming Alibaba's biggest competitor.Tencent failed to building its own online shopping service platform many years ago and changed the strategy to invest in other ecommerce companies such as JD.com,VIP.com and social ecommerce platform Pingduoduo.Ofo once took advantage of Ant Financial's credit service to attract more users.Like Didi chuxing,Alibaba also hoped to gain control of the company,but as ofo's main investor,Didi stood in Alibaba's way all the time.Alibaba finally dropped the idea and turned to Hellobike.</p>
<p>Hellobike is founded by Alibaba's former employees and receives financing from Alibaba and its financial affiliate,Ant Financial.Although Hellobike is not one of the early players who fight in the battlefield,it seems that Hellobike may be the most promising bike-sharing companies and laughs last.Rather than conquering big cities where there are fierce competitors like Beijing,Shanghai and Shenzhen,Hellobike starts from small cities and with the help of Ant Financial's credit service,Hellobike offers bike-sharing service to users free of deposit.That strategy helps Hellobike gain rapid traction.</p>

<h2 class="dh2">Alibaba and Tencent compete,again</h2>

<p>China's bike-sharing industry has changed a lot this year.It is interesting to wonder which company will stand out at last.But one thing is sure,just like mobile payments,ecommerce,retailing,cloud service and so on,bike-sharing industry will see China's Internet giants,Alibaba and Tencent race with each other again.</p></p></div>
