<div class="dpost"><p><p>Days must be hard for Dai Wei,who is the founder of the bike-sharing startup.</p>
<p><img src="https://wx2.sinaimg.cn/large/6ea67c04ly1fryvf67uipj21400u0adh.jpg" alt="an ofo bike" style="width: 450px;"></p>
<p>On June 1,there were rumors that ofo are running low on cash.The company had even started to plan significant layoffs and executives had experienced shifting dynamics within the power elite.Zhang Yanqi,the former COO of ofo,had left the company and the overseas division he had led was removed.</p>
<p>When asked about the rumor,public relations teams at ofo responded that the news is fake and everything at the ofo is normal.</p>
<p>Despite ofo's denials,Chinese tech media Huxiu still had collected some information from various sources that is opposite to what ofo had said.According to the sources,ofo's planning layoffs is undeniable and would be undertaken any time soon.The layoffs would probably be the biggest one since the founder Dai Wei established the bike-sharing startup when he was a university students.The elimination would be about 40 percent of the people and might be going bigger.It is said that all of ofo's product lines would be involved,including business teams and functioning divisions.47% of 80 people supply chain team member had been chosen to lay off previously,however,on June 1,the number increased to 60%.That is to say,there would be 32 lucky dogs who could survive.The director of overseas division Zhang Yanqi left the office and office was completely shut down.</p>
<p>It seems that ofo gets into trouble all of a sudden.But we can find out some clear evidence that ofo has been in trouble for a long time.</p>
<p>According to Caixin,there were only 350 million dollars in ofo's bank account in December 2017.At that time of the year,the cold weather gets in the way when people are making choices about commuting to some places.And revenues dropped significant and ofo was really having a hard time.</p>
<p>Meanwhile,ofo never has had a clear business model since its first day,which is one of the biggest reasons that stop it from gaining more capital backup from ventures.Mobike has been acquired by Meiuan Dianping,the Chinese delivery and food reviews unicorn.Meituan's ambitious founder Wang Xing is not satisfied with the company's territory and aimed at a big picture.After experiencing Mobike's main investor Tencent's heavy pressure,Mobike agreed to give in.Now that Mobike is part of Meituan Dianping,it certainly will receive financial support from Meituan Dianping.So the competition is becoming more and more fierce.However,as ofo's main shareholders,Didi chuxing and Alibaba may not give ofo a hand.</p>
<p>In just three years since its start in 2015, ofo has received a total of 10 financing rounds, 3.6 months per round. By the end of the 2017,ofo was valued at 3 billion dollars(about 19.3 billion yuan),jumping up from just 100 million yuan in April 2016.Its valuation has almost doubled just in a very short period of time,thanks to a lot of capital game.</p>
<p>However,ofo is running out of money,which would kill itself if the tough situation is not to be handled well.Perhaps in a few months,we will not have the chance to see people riding ofo's classic yellow bike again.</p></p></div>
