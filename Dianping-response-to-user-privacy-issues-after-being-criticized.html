<div class="dpost"><p><p>Dianping,a Chinese Internet platform focusing on user reviews and recommendations for food and entertainments,is involved in user privacy issues.The company is experiencing people's anger on China's social media. </p>
<p><img src="https://tc.sinaimg.cn/maxwidth.2048/tc.service.weibo.com/img3_jiemian_com/5670642b3f60abc7585d068390483183.jpg" alt="the launch screen of Dianping app says find quality life" style="width: 450px;"></p>
<h2 class="dh2">Your privacy is in the details</h2>

<p>On July 9, the economic daily reported that after logging in Dianping's service platform through Wechat,Dianping will take advantage of the information of users' Wechat account.By integrating data from users' contact address book of Wechat,Dianping identifies your friends and families on Dianping's platform and push some notifications including which restaurant you have been to ,what rating you have given and which hotel you have been interested to them.</p>
<p>After the news was released,Dianping said in an response to a news media of Tencent that Dianping was trying provide a feature that enables users who are willing to share moments with their friends on the platform,but the social feature was flawed and resulted in a bad user experience.Dianping added that users concern is not what they want.</p>
<p>In fact,user can find privacy related terms in the terms of service on Dianping's app.The "section 4:what you share" in the terms says that "When you communicate,transact or share through Dianping's platform,you can allow Dianping to get access to your contacts on your computers,phones or other third party social contacts.Users who are one of your contacts on Dianping's platform will also get access to your reviews,comments,transactions if they agree our terms os service."Though there are some hints that remind users of the issue,that information is not obvious.</p>
<p>The company said it would take some actions to solve the problem.They would add an function to the app that allow users to suspend all of the third party social feature in one click away.For users who log in Dianping' app through Wechat,Dianping will show notifications when they log in.Dianping said that the two functions will be integrated into the app the next day.The company would let users easily set their preferences,including add functions like "preventing others identify me through Wechat and QQ login","unfollowing friends","removing fans",and "black list".The service platform would let users to decide to whether to use some features or not.</p>
<h2 class="dh2">dianping's response to privacy issues</h2>

<p>The text is listed below:</p>
<p>Recently, there have been accusations about the Dianpin that the app shows which hotels and restaurants users' Wechat friends have been to.Dianping take the issue seriously.We did our research in no time.Here is the details of the issue and what we will do to fix that:</p>
<p>The original intention of Dianping to enhance the social connections of our users is to enable our users who is willing to share beautiful moments in life with others.But we have already found that such kind of feature is flawed in terms of user experience.That is not what we expected.We apologize for make troubles to our users.Dianping will change and update some the app from the following aspects:</p>
<p>1.Add a new function that disables all third-party social relations features of the Dianping app.After users enable that function,they can unfollow their Wechat friends and remove their Wechat friends from their fan list.</p>
<p>2.After logging into the Dianping platform through WeChat,the user will be fully prompted for importing their contacts from Wechat manually.</p>
<p>3.In the past few months,we have already add some functions to our app,including "don't let others identify me through Wechat and QQ","unfollowing friends","removing fans",and "black list".We will enhance those kind of app functions which will make users feel more autonomy and let users make decisions on their own.</p>
<p>Product functions in point 1 and 2 will be available from tomorrow. Thank you for the suggestions and supervision.Dianping is a user-generated content platform that aims to make people a better life.We will continue to improve the app and you are welcome to provide suggestions and make comments.</p>
<p>Dianping is founded in 2003 and is acquired by Meituan in 2015.The company is China's Yelp.</p></p></div>
